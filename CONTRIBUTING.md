###Opening issues

Before opening a new issue, please search the issues to see if there is one that is the same (or very similar) and add
to that issue before opening your own.

###Suggesting features

If you want to suggest a new feature for the mod, please search the issues to make sure it hasn't already been
suggested. If it is an original suggestion, open a new issue and give it the "suggested feature" tag.
